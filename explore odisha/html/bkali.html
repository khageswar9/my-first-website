As per the nomenclature of the goddess one tends to believe that it is the goddess Kali who is being worshiped in this Bhadrakali Pitha.However, since the deity is seated on a lion, one school of thought has opined that the goddess can be no other than the goddess This goddess is represented with three eyes, and four, twelve, or eighteen hands. She carries a number of weapons, with flames flowing from her head, and a small tusk protruding from her mouth. to legends originally Bhadrakali was worshiped inside a cave in the Meghasana hill of Mayurbhanj district by a sage named Tapasa Rushi. After the death of the sage, one of his pupil namely Bhadranatha brought the goddess to Bhunyamahalla of Bhadrak. To protect the deity from Kalapahad, she was again transferred to present place by the Dikshits.
                The last Independent King of Odisha Gajapati Mukunda Dev established the statu of Lorg Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra at Bhadrakali pitha.
