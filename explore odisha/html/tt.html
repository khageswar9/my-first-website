                Taratarini Temple on the Kumari hills at the bank of the River Rushikulya near Brahmapur city in Ganjam District, Odisha, India is worshiped as the Breast Shrine (Sthana Peetha) and manifestations of Adi Shakti.

                The mythological texts recognize four major Shakti Peethas: Tara Tarini (Stana Khanda), near Brahmapur; Bimala (Pada Khanda) inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri; Kamakhya (Yoni khanda), near Guwahati; and Dakshina Kalika (Mukha khanda) in Kolkata. There are 52 other sacred Shakti Peethas, which originated from the limbs of Mata Sati's corpse in the Satya Yuga.
                It has also been proposed to build a meditation centre, resting area, food kiosk, demarcated shoe stand, foot washing place, waiting area, barrier-free accessibility, seating arrangement, rest shed, watch tower, police outpost and first-aid centre. â€œThe periphery area of the temple will get a complete makeover.
