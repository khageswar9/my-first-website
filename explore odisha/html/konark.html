            <p>
                Konark Sun Temple, also called Konaditya and Arkakshetra, is situated north eastern corner of Puri on the coastline of Odisha, India.The name Konark is derived from the words Kona - Corner and Arka - Sun,dedicated to the Sun God. This temple built in 1278 CE by the Ganga King Narasimhadeva 1, the great ruler of the Ganga dynasty, with the help of 1200 artisans within a period of 12 years (1243-1255 A.D.). It is one of the grandest temples of India and was referred to as the Black Pagoda. Since the ruler used to worship the Sun, the temple was considered as a chariot for the Sun God. It is currently a 100 feet (30 m) high chariot with immense 24 wheels , each about 10 feet in diameter, and drawn by 7 mighty horses, all carved from stone.
                There are three images of the Sun God at three different sides of the temple, positioned in proper direction to catch the rays of the sun at morning, noon and evening. On the walls and roof of the temple beautiful erotic figures are carved. Sun temple of Konark is a masterpiece of Orissa's medieval architecture.
