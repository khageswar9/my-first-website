            <h2>Sapua Dam</h2>
            <p>The beauty of this dam is overwhelming. It attracts thousands of tourists during every picnic.
                The dam was originally built as a medium irrigation project by the Water Resource Department of Odisha, across a local nallah called ‘Sapua’ under the Mahanadi basin. This was reciprocally linked with the naming of this reservoir as ‘Sapua Dam.’ The dam was compled in 2006.

                Once a barred area, now this zone has turned out to be the first choice for camping, sightseeing and picnic by tourists. It is also surrounded by an adjacent dense saal forest, which gives it an edge.
                
                People from all across the state come here with families to behold the scenic beauty of this place and to spend some quality time.
