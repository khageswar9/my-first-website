        Khordha is a city and a municipality area in Khordha district in the Indian state of Odisha. Bhubaneswar, capital of Odisha, belongs to Khordha district and is only 25 km from Khordha town. Odisha State Highway 1 and National Highway 16 runs via this town.
        Khordha is one of the new districts carved out of the former Puri District on 1st April, 1993.

        The other new district carved out of Puri was Nayagarh. In the year 2000, the district’s name was changed from Khurda to Khordha. The district headquarters is located in Khordha Town, formerly known as Jajarsingh or Kurada, (kurada means foul mouthed). The old milestones of the area had the word KURADA which have now been white washed and the word “Khurdha” is written on them. About the origin of the word Khurda (as earlier called) it is also told that the word is derived from two Odia words- “Khura” and “Dhara”, meaning razor and edge, probably because the soldiers of Khurda were as sharp and dreadful as the edge of a razor. Neither of the two origins, however, can be called authentic.
        Khurda is an important centre of handloom industry. The lungi, Gamchha & Sarees produced here and popular outside Odisha for its quality. There are a few Hindu mathas in Gada Khurda i.e. the old fort area of the town. The civic affairs of the town are managed by Khordha Municipality.


        The erstwhile Puri district was divided to form three new districts in April 1993 and as a result Khordha district was formed taking Khordha & Bhubaneswar sub-divisions of Puri district.
