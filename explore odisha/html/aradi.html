            <h2>Bhadrakali</h2>
            <p>As the history runs, king Niladri Samara Singha Mohapatra started worshipping the God Akhandalamani some 350 years ago, when the black glazed granite stone was found underground and the king dreamt of the god. However the religious and historical significance with which the place is invested, constitute it to be a center of special interest in the tourism of Bhadrak. Moreover the artistic carvings of the temple deserve special worth to the tourist.
                 Akhandalamani Temple of Bhadrak Surrounding the temple many fairs and festivals are organized, the chief among whose is the Mahashivaratri. During this festival, tourists including a vast chunk of pilgrims flocked in the core of the temple. On the month of Sravana, akhapeople from nationwide assemble here to pour the holy water on the Siva Linga and to offer their worship to Lord Shiva. 
                The Akhandalamani Temple is the principal source of the profitable development of the tourism industry of Bhadrak.
