            <h2>Dhabaleswar Island</h2>
            <p>
                The enchanting water spread of Mahandi here provided ample opportunities for boating. There is a hanging bridge connecting the island from its northern side to Mancheswar.
                It is situated at a distance of 27 km from the city of Cuttack, on the exotic island of Lord Dhabaleshwar. The temple, located on an island on River Mahanadi, is embellished with stone carvings that date back to the early 10th and 11th century. The serene ambiance, in which the temple is situated, inspires spiritual feeling among one and all.
                Dhabaleswar is dedicated to Lord Shiva which is situated at the bank of Mahanadi River. The current of Mahanadi River is very swift so no bridge could be built. Later the hanging bridge successfully built. To reach at Dhabaleswar temple, we have to cross the hanging bridge. Dhabaleswar shrine is situated on an island. Literally Dhabaleswar means the lord of white, there so many mythologies behind the naming of this shrine.
