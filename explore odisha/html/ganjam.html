As of 2011 it is the most populous district of Odisha (out of 30)

        Ganjam was a part of ancient Dakshina Kalinga. The Mauryan emperor Ashoka inscribed his message at Jaugada near the banks of the Rushikulya, in the present-day Ganjam district. Scholars thus conclude that a significant part of Ganjam was under the rule of Ashoka. There are multiple theories regarding the name 'Ganjam'. During the 7th century, the region was known as Kangoda or Kongoda. Some scholars believe the word evolved from this ancient name. A second theory suggests that one Ibrahim Qutabshahi, Sultan of Golconda invaded the region in 1571 and the region later became known by the Persian adjective 'Ganj-i-am', meaning 'place of the commoners.
