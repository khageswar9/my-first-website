            <h2>Netaji Museum</h2>
            <p>

                History buffs interested in Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose will surely find the Netaji Museum in Odia Bazaar at Cuttack interesting. Netaji was born in Cuttack on January 23, 1897 at the Janakinath Bhawan, named after his father Janakinath Bose. This ancestral house has been converted into the Netaji Museum by the Odisha Government and memorabilia associated with the great leader are being showcased through 15 galleries. A large gate with green sculptures of Netaji leading his Indian National Army (INA) stands at the approach road to the museum. The wall on one side of the road has been decorated with graffiti on the various stages of life of the leader and outside the house, is a beautiful garden and a replica of a horse carriage used by Netaji.

                Inside, one gets to see his rare photographs, letters that he wrote to his family members during his stay in various jails and Netaji's INA uniform, among the various rare artefacts. The museum is a two storey house with 12 rooms and each room has been converted into a gallery. There is a study room that contains the table and chair of Netaji and book shelves, while in another gallery on his prison life, letters written by him from the prison have been exhibited. Netaji's rare letters that express his views about a strong and Independent India are the most prized possession of the museum. From 2010 to 2013, the Odisha Government added three more galleries to the museum which includes a special gallery that throws light on the spiritual aspect of Netaji. The spiritual beliefs of Netaji are not well known among people; not many know that Netaji always carried a copy of the Gita, a photo of Goddess Kali and Rudrakshya beads with him. Visitors have to pay a nominal entry fee to visit the museum.
