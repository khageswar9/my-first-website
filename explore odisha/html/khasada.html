            <h2> Khasada Waterfall</h2>
            <p>
                It is a small but pretty waterfall, which has become a popular picnic spot for the locals. Known as Khasada, this waterfall attracts visitors from far and near.
                This place has undergone some small commercialisation over the years. A designated paid parking spot, a shop renting out picnic utensils and small shops selling kumkum, have come up around the waterfall. Across the stream stands a small temple, for those willing to cross it, either through the water or a makeshift bridge made out of abandoned electricity poles.
                Khasada in the local language means Slippery, and it is once we stepped inside the water, did we realise why this name was endowed to this fall. Some of the stones we laid our foot were some of the slippery-est things we have ever walked on. Words of caution : take care of your steps when on Khasada.
