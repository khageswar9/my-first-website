            <p>

                The foundation of this grand temple was given on 21.2.1996 to build the temple like the model of world famous Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri . Then the construction work was progressed day by day with the help of administration and local people of Angul. Then the dream came true when the temple work was finished. At last, the District administration formed a trustee for the temple and the temple was opened for all public after completion of Pratistha Utsav on Dt.22.02.2002. It was a historic moment for the people of Angul. Now this place is called as Sailashreekhetra and people not only from Angul but also from whole State & other parts of India are coming to have a darshan of Lord Jagannath in this magnificent grand temple at Angul.
