            <h2>Panchalingeswar Temple</h2>
            <p>Panchalingeswar is located on hilltop of the Eastern Ghats in Panchalingeswar, Nilagiri surrounded with serene beauty. The main attraction of this place is a temple having five lingas with a perennial spring flows touching them. The place derived its name from the five lingams that are also known as Panchalingeswar. The five round natural stone structures called Shiva Linga are worshipped as Panchalingeswara. these lingams were installed in this beautiful abode by King Banasura himself, because of the serenity and beauty of its surrounding environs. To feel the lingas under the stream of water, one has to lie flat on the rock. 263 stairs have to be climbed to reach the sacred place. Monstrous rocks are scattered all over the hills and the silence of the forest prevails the beauty of that area. Panchalingeswar is actually part of the Kuldiha forest (an Elephant Sanctuary). Many animals including elephants, bison, bears, deers, and panthers are found in this forest.
